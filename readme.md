# Health Catalyst Application Program
Brandon Buchanan | November 7, 2016

## Introduction

This repository contains code developed for the Health Catalyst pre interview application.  The application allows a user to search a database of people, and returns the results using an AJAX call.
In addition, the program also allows a user to view all people in the database, add additional people, remove people and edit current records in the database.

## Installation

Once this repository is cloned on a local machine, running the program is as easy as opening the solution in Visual Stuidos.

## Requirements

* Visual Stuidos 2015 (built using Community version, other years or versions may perform differently)
* Entity Framework with local MsSql
* DataTable CDN (connection to the internet is required to view this properly)
